Changes:
This document appears to be written in Russian but the html start tag has lang="en". Consider using lang="ru" (or variant) instead. So, I changed it to "ru"
I changed the backgroung color also for more visual match with logo.
Changed Fonts: text to georgia, phone numbers - arial.
href="./ООО _Телеавтоматика_ Официальный партнёр и представитель ООО _Инженерный центр _Энергосервис_ в Республике Беларусь_files/main.css" is not good for computer reading? so i changed padding to %20
 The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources so I just removed them
 The align and border attribute on the table element is obsolete - removed
 Solved duplicate id porblem
 Also some img elements didn't have alt attributes. I wrote them
 The charset attribute on the script element is obsolete s I leaved 1 at the begining and other were removed
  Element meta is missing one or more of the following attributes: itemprop, property (it must be property)

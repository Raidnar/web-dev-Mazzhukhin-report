Changes:<br>
This document appears to be written in Russian but the html start tag has lang="en". Consider using lang="ru" (or variant) instead. So, I changed it to "ru"<br>
I changed the backgroung color also for more visual match with logo.<br>
Changed Fonts: text to georgia, phone numbers - arial.<br>
href="./ООО _Телеавтоматика_ Официальный партнёр и представитель ООО _Инженерный центр _Энергосервис_ в Республике Беларусь_files/main.css" is not good for computer reading? so i changed padding to %20<br>
 The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources so I just removed them<br>
 The align and border attribute on the table element is obsolete - removed<br>
 Solved duplicate id porblem<br>
 Also some img elements didn't have alt attributes. I wrote them<br>
 The charset attribute on the script element is obsolete s I leaved 1 at the begining and other were removed<br>
